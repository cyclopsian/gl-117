/**
* Load up a TGA file.
* 
* As written the function load() only recognizes the following types of Targas: 
*		Type 02 - Uncompressed RGB, 24 or 32 bits 
*		Type 03 - Uncompressed grayscale, 8 bits
*		Type 10 - RLE-compressed RGB, 24 or 32 bits
*		Type 11 - RLE-compressed grayscale, 8 bits  
* There are several other (uncommon) Targa formats which it can't currently handle.
