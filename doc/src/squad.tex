Use FF missiles early when approaching the enemy.
They will search their target using a radar system,
however a chaff cloud may fool them.

IR missiles can only track the enemy by heat and must
therefore be fired at the enemy's back.
Flares consisting of burning magnesium can be used as a countermeasure.

AGMs are radar controlled missiles used to
take out medium ground targets like tanks.

DF missiles will only fly straight ahead like cannon shots,
but can cause an enormous amount of damage,
so they are used to take out huge ground targets like buildings.
